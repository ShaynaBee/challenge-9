# Challenge-9 Analysis



## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to compile the data for the tempuratures in June and December in Oahu. These results would show if a Surf and Ice Cream shop would be a sustaninable business all year-round.


## Results

1. Our results showed that tempuratures didn't have much variation between the June and December months, with the avergaes being 74.94 and 71.04 respectively. Both of which are good tempuratues, given the proper weather conditions such as clear sunny skies, to spend the day on the beach.
2. We also saw that December had a higher rate of standard deveation than June, so there could be more polarizing days during that time that wouldn't be ideal to open the shop. So possibly planning for a smaller staff count during those months to reduce costs would be helpful.
3. We also see that December had a minimum tempurature of 56 versus June's of 64, as well as a Q1 temp of 69 in December and 73 in June. This further shows that while with proper management the shop can be open year round, extra care should be taken in the winter months to cover costs of reduced traffic.


## Summary

I believe this analysis was very helpful in showing that the shop could easily be maintained in that climate year round with proper financial planning. However, I believe further analysis is needed into the weather conditions of each day before a decision is made. What we arent seeing is how many of those seemingly good tempurate days were also during rain or thunderstors. This would greatly impact traffic as a rainy day with a temp of 70, would possibly deter more people than a sunny day at 63.
